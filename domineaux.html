		<h1>I like the game dominoes</h1>
		<p>Quite a bit. I like it so much, that I have had lots of fun coming up with some alternative rules for the game. Specifically, I play muggins or fives, but there are lots of variations on this game so I'll go over the basics.</p>
<p>The game can be played with two to four players with a six-six domino set. Each player randomly draws 7 tiles. The player with the highest double goes first, and then the game proceeds with each player laying a tile adjacent to a previously placed tile, such that one of the sides on the current tile matches one of the ends of the rows of dominos. The player gets a point if the sum of the pips on all ends of the rows is divisible by five. The number of points awarded is sum / 5.</p>
<p>When a double tile is played, it must be played sideways, and it adds to the sum of the points on the board, double the face value of one of its sides. For example, if a five-five is played, it will add ten points to the board.</p>
<p>So if you've been following along, you might have a row of dominoes that you've built up, by playing off one side or the other. However, there's more to this game, because once the first double has been 'closed-off,' then you can extend two more rows off the perpendicular axes of that double. Following the example above, after the five-five is played, and then someone else plays a five-something on the other side of the five-five, it has been closed off, and now the next player can lay down some other five tile adjacent to the side of the five-five. Note that the double no longer contributes points to the total on the board, once it has been closed off.</p> 
<p>If a player has no move, then they must draw from the pile of undrawn tiles until they can play or the pile is exhausted. Once a player plays their last tile, the game is concluded and all other players must surrender their remaining tiles to the winner. The winner gets 1 additional point for every tile with a sum of pips greater than or equal to 5, and 2 additional points for every tile with a sum of pips greater than or equal to 10.</p>

<p>Now we get to the interesting part. I think I've covered all the basic rules above, so now let's look into some other, interesting modifications to the game!</p>
